The consideration of the ethical and social implications of technology and the basic concepts of business are also aspects of the course. Each student design team is expected to present information related to their project in both written and oral formats. Preliminary paper design is followed by implementation in the lab using digital and analog hardware design techniques and through software engineering. It is expected that a complete or partially working system will be demonstrated at the end of the course.</td>

                    During the summer of 2016 I worked at ViaSat Inc. Where two other interns and I worked on BaaS (Builds as a Service).
                    We used Python, Bash, Ansible, Docker, and Openstack to create a CLI and API that developers could use to quickly deploy Jenkins CI servers to the cloud.
                    The service allowed developers to store configuration in version control and migrate non-BaaS servers to our service. All of this was done with an Agile Scrum developement process
                    and all of our work had documentation written by us to allow users to continue our work when we left.

                  Two classmates and I worked with Altera 2 developement boards to simulate a remote camera. We were tasked with
                  linking the two boards through ethernet and sending instructions from a one to another using software-defined network layers that we created in C++ and Verilog.
                  A 'master' board would sent commands to a 'slave' board to take an image, manipulate it in one of several ways, then compress and send the image back to the master.
                  We designed the entirety of the system and the TCP protocol used to transmit and achknowledge the packets of data that the slave and master sent.
                  We were judged by the effectiveness of our compression and the robustness of our system.

                  a general purpose MIDI explorer with an Atmel Atmega32 AVR chip and C code. Our team met frequently and divied the hardware, software
                  and testing requirements among our members. By using the datasheet for the chip and our compression algorithm,
                  we were able to store up to 1KB of audio on the chip's memory and play back the original recording. For extra credit, we added a photodiode that changed the
                  way that the audio was played back depending on the light hitting it. The project involved debugging the code using gcc debugger, the hardware using a multimeter, and
                  the signals using a logic analyzer.
